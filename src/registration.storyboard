# Start
bot: Hi there!
bot: My name's Floyd. I'm here to help get you registered for Roguelike Celebration.
bot: You'll have to bear with me â€” I'm a pretty simple robot, so I can't really help you out with anything complicated.
bot: But I just have a few questions to ask you before I can get you set up with a profile and send you on your way!
wait: 2
bot: Let's start with the basics. 
bot: What username would you like? This is what people will see in the chat interface, like a Twitter handle or an IRC nickname.
-> realName: [username isnt empty and valid is true]
<-> [username isnt empty and valid is false]
    bot: I'm so sorry, but the username '{username}' has already been taken! Try another one?

# realName
bot: Great! Nice to meet you, {username}
bot: Next, I need to know your real name. This doesn't need to be your legal name, but we think being able to see what somebody goes by offline will help create a sense of community.
-> pronouns: [username isnt empty]

# pronouns
bot: Perfect, noted!
bot: Next, what pronouns would you like other people to call you? This might be something like "she/her" or "he/him or they/them", but all forms of gender identity are welcome here.
-> description: [pronouns isnt empty]

# description
bot: Ooh, good choice!
bot: When other players look at you, what do they see? Enter a short text description of your character. This doesn't need to be what you look like in real life, or even a description of a human!
-> twitter: [description isnt empty]

# twitter
bot: Fantastic!
bot: Do you have a Twitter handle you would like to display on your profile? You can type "skip" if not.
-> url: [twitter isnt empty]

# url
bot: something that's clever based on whether you entered something or not
bot: Do you have another URL you want to publicize on your profile? Maybe a personal site, a Twitch stream, or anything else you want people to check out. Again, you can type "skip" if you're not interested.
-> askMeAbout: [url isnt empty]

# askMeAbout
bot: We're almost done, thanks for hanging in there!
bot: Is there anything you're particularly excited to talk to people about? Say a few words about what excites you here, or again feel free to type "skip".
-> confirmation: [askMeAbout is true]

# confirmation
bot: And that's all my questions!
revealProfile
bot: Check out your profile on the side here, and change any answers you want. When you're ready to head on in, type "okay" into the chat box.
-> coc: [confirmed is true]
<-> [confirmed is false]
    bot: Say the word "okay" when you're ready to move on.

# coc
hideProfile
bot: Whew! We did it! 
bot: Just ONE last thing, but the most important one. 
bot: I need you to read our [code of conduct]() and type "yes" to signify that you've read it before I can let you in.
-> done: [coc is true]

# done
bot: ðŸŽ‰
bot: Fantastic! I hope you have an amazing conference.
bot: To head on into the conference, just type "/move bar" to move to the bar area just inside.
